# Advent of Code

This repository will contain my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. I am starting seriously this year (2021) and will see until which day I will manage to go. AsI cannot follow the daily pace, I intend to solve them at my own pace and will also tackle the previous years challenges. This will be a good way to shape my coding skills in different languages (Python, Scala and Rust)

## 2021 with Scala

Solutions are not necessarly scala idiomatic and do not harness all its features. But I tried here to focus on a functional programming approach and respect immutability as far as I could. By doing this I can see that immutability somehow forces me to use a lot of recrusive algorithms.
