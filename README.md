# Advent of Code

This repository will contain my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. I started seriously in 2021 and see until which day I will manage to go.
I cannot follow the pace of the daily publishing so I intend to do these at my own pace and will also tackle the previous years challenges as a good way to shape my coding in different languages.

## 2021 with Scala

Solutions are not necessarly scala idiomatic and do not harness all the scala features / idioms. But I tried here to focus on some functional programming approach and respect immutability as far as I could. By doing this I can see that immutability somehow forces me to harness recrusive algorithms.
